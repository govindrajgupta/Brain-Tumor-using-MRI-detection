# Brain Tumor Detection Using MRI Images

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning solution for automated detection of brain tumors from MRI images. The system uses convolutional neural networks to classify MRI scans as either containing tumors or being tumor-free, providing a valuable tool for assisting medical professionals in diagnosis.

## Features
- Preprocessing of MRI images for optimal model performance
- Deep learning model for binary classification of brain tumors
- Visualization tools for model interpretation
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing new MRI scans
- Detailed evaluation metrics and performance analysis

## Dataset
The model is trained on [specify dataset name], containing MRI scans categorized

The dataset consists of X training images and Y testing images across all classes.

## Model Architecture
The project implements a [CNN/Transfer Learning model name] architecture with the following key components:
